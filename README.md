#Fly the friendly skies

![pilot](http://www.quirkus.net/images/funny-airplane-picture-1.jpg)

**Find a partner for this lab.** 

You and your co-pilot are on a cross-country flight from New York to LA. You don't feel like talking to your passengers though, so you decide to program your computer to announce each state as you fly over it. (You might need to look at a map of the US to plan out your route and see which states you will be flying over.) Here is an example of what one of your methods might look like:

```ruby
def pennsylvania
  "We're flying over pimptastic Pennsylvania!"
end
``` 

Write your methods out in a new fly_over.rb file and puts each of your methods at the bottom of the file. Then run your program to see your trip.

### Bonus Items
* Get excited! Puts the messages about your favorite states in all caps.

* Confuse the passengers! Puts your least favorite states backwards.

* Safety first! As the pilot it's your job to keep everyone safe. Write two methods `fasten_seatbelts` and `free_to_move_about_the_cabin` that return the appropriate messages.
