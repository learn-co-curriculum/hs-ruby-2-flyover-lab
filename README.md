#Fly Over States

**Find a partner for this lab.** 

You and your co-pilot are on a cross-country flight from LA to New York. You decide to write a method that will announce each state that you fly over. You know, something like this: "We are now flying over wonderful Wyoming!" (You might need to look at a map of the US to plan out your route.)

Discuss your approach to the problem before you start coding then write out your code in the fly_over.rb file. Make sure to call or puts your method(s) at the bottom of the file when you are done and run your program to see your trip.


### Bonus Items
 * Did you know that you can call methods within methods? How might that be useful?

 * Automate your whole crew! Try writing flight attendant methods that interact with passengers.
